Try create table using Telerik Reporting on .Net Web Form

First try to use Telerik Reporting to create a Table on a report view,
also my first time to create a WebForm aplication.

Trying to know how to create a column, row dynamically, helping colleague to figure out what casuses the problem in our project.
(Yesterday, we just had code review.)

Take some notes.
